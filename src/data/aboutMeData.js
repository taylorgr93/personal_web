    Electronics Engineering, I have over five years of experience as a Full 
    Stack Developer, specializing in MERN technologies (MongoDB, Express JS, 
    React, NodeJS). My expertise lies in developing applications for 
    Industry 4.0 and IoT, enabling real-time monitoring of variables for 
    efficient decision-making. I am adept in cloud computing with AWS 
    (EC2, S3, Lambda), Docker, and REST API creation. My experience extends
    to Linux systems (Raspbian, Ubuntu, Manjaro) on projects involving 
    embedded systems like Raspberry Pi. As a Software Test Engineer, I 
    automated processes using web technologies (C#, ASP .NET, HTML, 
    JavaScript, CSS) and maintained C# applications. My role as a 
    Support Engineer involved developing .NET applications for product
    validation and process improvement, along with database management
    (SQL Server, MySQL), and version control systems (Mercurial, SVN, Git).
    I have provided direct customer support, including on-site assistance in
    Mexico City, showcasing my versatility and commitment to excellence in
    software development and engineering.`,
